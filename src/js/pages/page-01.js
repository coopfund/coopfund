			The purpose of Coop Fund is to
				<ul id="purpose-ul">
					<a class="anchor-50px" id="resources-ref"></a>
					<li>
						Generate <a href="#resources">resources</a> and discussion with individuals and/or collectives who want to formalize their working practices.
					</li>
					<a class="anchor-50px" id="member-ref"></a>
					<a class="anchor-50px" id="needs-ref"></a>
					<li>
						Recognize <a href="#member">members</a> have individual <a href="#needs">needs</a> and that these needs affect one's ability to participate in collective work.
					</li>
					<a class="anchor-50px" id="proposal-ref"></a>
					<li>
						Support <a href="#proposal">proposals</a> that struggle to get support elsewhere, either because it's a project or group that is not formally constituted, because of the political content of the proposal, or because the protocols of the funding process are exclusionary.
					</li>
					<li>
						Resist the current forms of investor-owned, corporate, for-profit business models that dominate most areas of life, and bring into question the non-profit model and its over-reliance on wealthy elites.
					</li>
					<a class="anchor-30px" id="community-ref"></a>
					<li>
							Address inequitable wealth distribution and the causes of injustice and inequality in our <a href="#community">community</a> through solidarity and discussion.
					</li>
					<li>
						Work in the field of cultural production. We donâ€™t see this field as exceptional, or exempt from the need to develop ideas for structural change in regards to wealth distribution and democratic work practices. In fact, we know that this field is highly unregulated, exploitative and exclusionary at all levels.
					</li>
					<li>
						Show solidarity with historical and contemporary anticapitalist struggles, and acknowledge how these struggles have also tried to defend against the violence of white supremacy, heterosexism, ableism, gender binaries and environmental destruction.
					</li>
				</ul>
