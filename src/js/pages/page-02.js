				Following this course Emma conducted further research into cooperative organizations in Edinburgh, with <a href="http://www.rhubaba.org" target="_blank">Rhubaba Gallery</a>, and <a href="https://www.theshowroom.org" target="_blank">The Showroom</a> in London.

				In August 2017, Emma joined with Lydia Okrent and Elsa Brown in New York and together they started to work on the development of an online and in person cooperative funding platform, Coop Fund.

			<p>
				Coop Fund is inspired by the many historical and contemporary international types of Rotating Savings and Credit Associations and <a href="https://solidfund.coop" target="_blank">Solidfund</a>, a workers cooperative in the U.K..
